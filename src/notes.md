 React is a declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
 It lets you compose Uis from small and isolated pieces of code called "components"
 Components are used to tell React what to display on the screen.
 When our data changes React will efficiently update and render our components.
 Components take in parameters called props(short for "properties") and returns are hierarchy of views to be displayed via the render method.
Render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. Render returns as React element - a  lightweight description if what to render.
